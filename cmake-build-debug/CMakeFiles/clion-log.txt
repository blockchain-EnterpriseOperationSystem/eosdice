CMake Error at D:/MYTOOLS/cmake-3.7.2-win64-x64 (1)/cmake-3.7.2-win64-x64/share/cmake-3.7/Modules/CMakeMinGWFindMake.cmake:12 (message):
  sh.exe was found in your PATH, here:

  G:/toolss/Git/usr/bin/sh.exe

  For MinGW make to work correctly sh.exe must NOT be in your path.

  Run cmake from a shell that does not have sh.exe in your PATH.

  If you want to use a UNIX shell, then use MSYS Makefiles.
